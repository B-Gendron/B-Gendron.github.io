_Master 2 project - Network Analysis for Life Sciences_  
_From September 2022 to January 2023_  
_Supervision: University of Luxembourg, LCSB (Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine)_

Implementation of a data-driven approach to analyse gene counts from single-cell analysis in order to describe the impact of a specific mutation on the development of Parkinson's Disease. The main tool used in this project was `Seurat` object from the R library which allow to perform quality control, filtering, visualization and clustering on the data.
