## Meta-Learning for Emotion Detection in Conversational Context
_From March 2023 to August 2023_  
_Supervision: University of Luxembourg, LORIA (Nancy, France)_

In this work, we use a deep learning-based meta-learning model to predict emotions in conversations. For this purpose, we have built utterance representations that take into account their conversational context. By adding such information, we aim to ensure the relevance of predictions, as well as good generalization to previously unseen dialogues and emotions.
