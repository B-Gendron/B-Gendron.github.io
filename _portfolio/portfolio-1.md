## Unsupervised alignment for bio-medical data
_Since 2022_  
_Supervision: Ã‰cole des Mines de Nancy & LORIA_

Multilingual information retrieval in bio-medical context, leading to the writing of a survey on multilingual language models properties. In this project I had to get familiar with supervised and unsupervised word alignment methods in a multilingual context, along with some knowlegde about Transformer-based multilingual models such as mBERT or XLM-R. The aim of this work was to describe and discuss both language-agnostic and language-specific properties of multilingual words representations.
