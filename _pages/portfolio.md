## Master 1 research project in Natural Language Processing
### __Since 2022__
### __Supervision: Ã‰cole des Mines de Nancy & LORIA__

Multilingual information retrieval in bio-medical context, leading to the writing of a survey on multilingual language models properties. In this project I had to get familiar with supervised and unsupervised word alignment methods in a multilingual context, along with some knowlegde about Transformer-based multilingual models such as mBERT or XLM-R. The aim of this work was to describe and discuss both language-agnostic and language-specific properties of multilingual words representations. 

## Master 2 project in Network Analysis for Life Sciences
### __From September 2022 to January 2023__
### __Supervision: University of Luxembourg, LCSB (Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine)__

Implementation of a data-driven approach to analyse gene counts from single-cell analysis in order to describe the impact of a specific mutation on the development of Parkinson's Disease. The main tool used in this project was `Seurat` object from the R library which allow to perform quality control, filtering, visualization and clustering on the data.
